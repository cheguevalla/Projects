1. Logging is a systematic recording of events, messages, or data generated by a software application or system during its execution.

2. Logging is crucial for several reasons:

Debugging: Pinpointing the root cause of issues becomes easier with detailed logs.

Monitoring: Tracking application performance, resource utilization, and error rates.

Auditing: Maintaining a record of system activities for compliance and security purposes.

Troubleshooting: Analyzing log data to identify and resolve problems.

Understanding User Behavior: Gathering information about user interactions.

3. Logging levels categorize the severity of log messages. Common levels include:

DEBUG: Detailed information for development and debugging.

INFO: General information about the application's status.

WARN: Potential issues or unexpected conditions.

ERROR: Errors that prevent correct operation.

FATAL: Critical errors that terminate the application.
